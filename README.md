✨Fun fact! I once built a Keanu Reeves face detector! I like to think that it works, but feel free to swap the reference image and test it yourself! Also, I love ethical hacking. My friends call it "being hacked". I call it "field testing"....they're my cherished test subjects (with their blessing of course) 😏
